## TODO
### Doors
- Slim doors
- Array of doubles containing values saying how open is the door. Use frame time to modify value. Also modify texture x coord.
- Array of int. Status of the door.

### Animated Sprites
- No complex AI. Just sprites moving randomly around.
- Use 2 textures depending on frame time (maybe).
